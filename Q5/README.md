# Data Aggregation Utility

This Python script allows users to aggregate data from a list of dictionaries by grouping them by a specified key and applying an aggregation function to the grouped values.

## Project Overview

The `aggregate_data` function takes a list of dictionaries, a key to group by, and an aggregator function. It groups the data based on the unique values of the specified key and applies the aggregator to compute an aggregated result for each group.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the files**.
   
   No external dependencies are needed for this project, but it's recommended to create a virtual environment for any Python project.

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    Install dependencies:

    Since no external dependencies are required, you can proceed to run the script directly after activating the virtual environment.

Usage

    Run the script:

    bash

    python aggregate_data.py

    The script will group the sample data based on the 'region' key and aggregate the sales for each region using the sum_sales function.

Example Output

bash

{'North': 250, 'South': 450, 'East': 300}

Customization

You can modify the data, key, and aggregator function as needed.
Data

The script is currently working with the following sample data:

python

data = [
    {'region': 'North', 'sales': 150},
    {'region': 'South', 'sales': 200},
    {'region': 'North', 'sales': 100},
    {'region': 'East', 'sales': 300},
    {'region': 'South', 'sales': 250}
]

Aggregator Function

You can replace the sum_sales function with any custom aggregator function. The aggregator function receives a list of grouped dictionaries and should return a single aggregated result (e.g., sum, average, max, etc.).

python

def sum_sales(items):
    return sum(item['sales'] for item in items)

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Standard Python libraries: typing

Migrations

No database migrations are required for this project.
Notes

    The function does not use any built-in grouping methods like groupby from itertools, ensuring compatibility with custom logic.
    Modify the aggregator function as needed for your use case.

### Steps to Run:

1. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python aggregate_data.py
    ```

### Key Components:

- **Script**: Implements the aggregation logic, which groups by a specified key and applies an aggregator function to each group.
- **Requirements.txt**: Empty, as no additional packages are needed.
- **README.md**: Contains all the steps to set up and run the project, including how to modify the data and aggregator.
