# Rate Limiter in Python

This project implements a rate limiter in Python that limits the number of requests a user can make within a given time window. Each user is allowed a maximum of 5 requests per 60 seconds.

## Project Overview

- **Rate Limiting Logic**: The program restricts requests for each user by tracking request timestamps.
- **Concurrency Handling**: The program ensures thread safety using Python's `threading.Lock` to prevent race conditions in a highly concurrent environment.

## Installation

No external dependencies are required for this project. Just ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download the repository**.
2. **Run the script** using Python:

    ```bash
    python rate_limiter.py
    ```

## Example Scenario

The script simulates requests from `user_1`. The rate limiter allows up to 5 requests within a 60-second window. If the user makes more than 5 requests, the excess requests are denied.

### Example Output

```bash
Request allowed for user user_1
Request allowed for user user_1
Request allowed for user user_1
Request allowed for user user_1
Request allowed for user user_1
Request denied for user user_1
Request denied for user user_1

Configuration

You can adjust the rate limiter settings by modifying the following parameters in the script:

python

rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=5, time_window=60)  # 5 requests per minute

    max_requests: Maximum number of requests allowed within the time window.
    time_window: The time window (in seconds) within which requests are limited.

Migrations

No database migrations are required for this project.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Standard libraries: time, threading, collections.defaultdict

Notes

    The rate limiter is designed to handle concurrent requests safely using a threading.Lock.
    If running in a distributed environment, further modifications would be required to handle rate-limiting across multiple servers or instances.

 
### Explanation of the Project Structure:
1. **Script**: Implements the rate limiter and handles concurrency.
2. **Requirements.txt**: Empty since no external libraries are needed (pandas, requests, etc.). You can skip it for this project.
3. **README.md**: Provides detailed setup, usage, configuration, and project overview.

This structure will help users set up and run the project easily and understand how to configure it according to their needs.
